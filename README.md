# Livecode Clinic for Blackjack Assignment

### Description
This repo contains the code for my livecode clinic for the Winter 2016 Launch
Academy cohort. Students should note the handling of the ace conundrum that has
plagued you all during this assignment! There are definitely opportunities for you
all to refactor this code and if you're cloning it down for practice, you should
definitely do that.

Remember this assignment is all about making effective use of POROs to clean up
your code and make it as readable as possible. Getting a working solution to this
challenge won't take you the full three days, getting a working solution that is
tested and that any developer can quickly read will. Use this week as an 
opportunity to shore up your Ruby skills as we head into Rails and React over the
next few weeks!
